<div><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><h3 align="center"><u>Disclosure  and Consent</u></h3></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr><tr> <td><p>I (Melinda Hill) am a practicum student completing my Master of Science in Counseling at Northwest Nazarene University. I obtained a Bachelor of Science from Brigham Young University-Idaho. I am a member of the American Counseling Association (ACA) and the Idaho Counseling Association (ICA). My emphasis area is Marriage, couples, and families.</p></td>  </tr><tr> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr><td><p>I enjoy working with couples, individuals, children, adolescents, and families. In working with couples and families, I use family systems and attachment-based perspective. Couple and family relationships are dynamic, and we will work collaboratively to improve and strengthen those relationships. I work from a holistic view of the person, which involves looking at mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. My theoretical orientation for counseling comes from Family Systems, Person-Centered, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and other counseling approaches. As each couple, family and individual are unique with differing circumstances; treatment approaches are tailored to best meet the needs of the client.</p></td> </tr> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr> <td><p align="left"><strong>Confidentiality</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>The information you share in therapy is confidential. I cannot release  information to another party without your written consent. Confidentiality laws  do require that I make exceptions in some very limited circumstances. If I believe  that you are seriously dangerous to yourself or others, I have both a legal and  ethical responsibility to report this and seek the necessary help for you. If a  child is being abused, I have a responsibility to report that as well.</td></tr><tr> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td>I seek consultation at times from other professionals. Your case may be  discussed for the purpose of maintaining the highest quality care. A  professional consultant is also bound by the legal responsibility of protecting  your confidentiality. Additionally, Kuna Counseling Center (KCC) may have  non-professional staff such a secretary that may schedule appointments, make  reminder calls, arrange files, or perform other tasks that would allow them to  know you are client of KCC. Such staff is also bound to confidentiality as part  of their work agreement. If you have any questions about this, please ask.</td></tr> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr> <td><p align="left"><strong>Professional Fees</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p align="left">The fee is $100.00 for a fifty-minute (50) session, which is  often covered by your insurance provider. You will be charged for phone time  with you or on your behalf, and letters or reports including preparation time.  If I am required to appear in court, you will be charged $120.00 per  hour to cover the additional requirements of travel and being out of my office. <strong>All fees are due and payable at the time of the service.</strong> Make payment to  Kuna Counseling Center. There will be a $20.00 service charge for  any returned checks.</p></td> </tr> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr><td><p align="left"><strong>Cancellations and missed  appointments </strong></p></td></tr> <tr><td><p>Time  is important to all of us. If you are unable to keep an appointment, please  notify KCC at least 24 hours in advance. You can cancel by calling 922-9001,  which is available 24 hours a day, Monday through Friday and records the time  of call.&nbsp;<strong>Any cancellation or missed appointment after the 24-hour  deadline may forfeit your time slot with the counselor.</strong> If it happens  again, you may be removed from the counselors schedule and placed on a waiting  list to be re-admitted to counseling.&nbsp;Medical and other emergencies will  be taken into consideration. When you decide to discontinue therapy, we ask  that you discuss this with the therapist at a regular therapy session.</p></td> </tr> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>SUPERVISION:</strong></td></tr> <tr><td>In working towards my clinical licensure, I receive clinical supervision  from Jim Grigg, LCPC, LMFT who currently works at Kuna Counseling Center and  can be reached there at 208-922-9001 or 145 E, Deer Flat Rd. Kuna, ID.  83634.  In the process of supervision  your case may or may not be discussed with him and he will be under the same  limits of confidentiality as stated above.</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Grievance/Complaints</strong></td></tr> <tr><td><p align="left">Initial complaints should be addressed with your  counselor. However, if you are unable to resolve your concern or do not feel  safe to approach your counselor with your concern, you may notify the clinical  director.  The clinical director will  help you mediate a solution to your concern or will provide alternative  services/providers to meet your needs.   As a client, you have the right to make complaints regarding ethical  concerns to the Bureau of Occupational Licenses, 208-334-3233.  You should be aware that sexual intimacy is  never appropriate with a client and should be reported to the board. In  addition you have the right to be a participant in treatment decisions, to seek  a second opinion, to file a complaint without retaliation, and to refuse  treatment. </p></td> </tr> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td><p align="left"><strong>Emergency and Crisis Availability</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr><td>We ask you to be aware that KCC is not an emergency service, and that in  an emergency situation if you cannot reach your therapist, we ask you to  contact your local community mental health center or another crisis counseling  hotline.

It is my firm conviction that for counseling to be  effective, there needs to be a committed partnership between the counseling  staff and clients. Clients are equal and indispensable partners in treatment.  As such, it is expected that they will be actively involved in the development  of a goal-oriented treatment contract. Additionally, this is a professional  relationship and it is my policy to maintain only a professional relationship  with you. I cannot accept gifts, invitations, or engage in a business/personal  relationship with you. These guidelines are meant to insure the quality of your  care.</td> </tr> <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center"><table width="80%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr> <td><hr /></td>  </tr></table></td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p align="left">My signature signifies that I have read, understand  and accept these conditions and policies and agree to enter therapy.

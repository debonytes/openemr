The goal of counseling services is to assist participants with emotional and mental disorders including assessment, treatment, and management. It is also to aid them in recovery of both acute and chronic symptoms of their mental and emotional disorders. There are risks and benefits which may occur in counseling. The risks to therapy often involve discussing unpleasant aspects of your life, and you may experience uncomfortable feelings like sadness, guilt, anger, frustration, loneliness, and helplessness. Approaching feelings or thoughts that you have tried not to think about for a long time may be painful. Making changes in your beliefs or behavior can be scary, and sometimes as you change, the relationships around you may change. However, the benefits of counseling typically outweigh the risks. The benefits from counseling may be an improved ability to relate with others, a clearer understanding of self, values, goals, increase productivity in work, school, and relationships, and an improved ability to deal with everyday stresses. Counseling may help relieve the stress and impaired functioning associated with trauma, grief and mental disorders. In fact, recent research has demonstrated that some types of psychotherapy offer better or equal treatment results at a lower cost than medication.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><p><strong>YOUR RIGHT TO REFUSE</strong><br />You have the right to refuse any service which you do not want, or to discontinue any services you have already started.

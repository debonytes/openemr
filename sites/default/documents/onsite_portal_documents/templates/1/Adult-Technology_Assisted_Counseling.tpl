<div><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr><td><h3 align="center">TECHNOLOGY ASSISTED COUNSELING (TAC) CONSENT, POLICIES, &amp; AGREEMENT</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>This form is in addition to the regular Therapy, Policies, Agreement and Consent Form and Notice of Privacy Practices for Protected Health Information commonly known as HIPAA. You must sign both in order to participate in Technology Assisted Counseling (TAC) sessions. TAC incorporates phone and video counseling.</p></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Benefits:</strong> The benefits to TAC counseling are:<ol><li>The ability to expand your choice of service provider.</li><li>More convenient counseling options including location, time, no driving, etc.</li><li>Reduces the overall cost and time of therapy due to not having to drive to and from and office.</li> <li>Ability to have real time monitoring and reduces the wait time for scheduling office appointments.</li> <li>Increased availability of services to homebound clients, clients with limited mobility, clients with risk for contracting diseases, and clients without convenient transportation options.</li></ol></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Limitations:</strong> It is important to note that there are limitations to TAC counseling that can affect the quality of the session(s). These limitations include but are not limited to the following:<ol><li>If video is not used, I cannot see you, your body language, or your non-verbal reactions to what we are discussing.</li><li>Due to technology limitations I may not hear all of what you are saying and may need to ask you to repeat things.</li><li>Technology might fail before or during the TAC counseling session.</li><li>To reduce the effect of these limitations, I may ask you to describe how you are feeling, thinking, and/or acting in more detail than I would during a face-to-face session. You may also feel that you need to describe your feelings, thoughts, and/or actions in more detail than you would during a face-to-face session.</li></ol> </td> </tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Logistics:</strong> When I provide phone/video-counseling sessions, I will call you at our scheduled time or send you a link for our secure and HIPAA compliant video session. I expect that you are available at our scheduled time and are prepared, focused and engaged in the session. I am calling you from a private location where I am the only person in the room. You also need to be in a private location where you can speak openly without being overheard or interrupted by others to protect your own confidentiality. If you choose to be in a place where there are people or others can hear you, I cannot be responsible for protecting your confidentiality. Every effort MUST be made on your part to protect your own confidentiality. I suggest you wear a headset to increase confidentiality and also increase the sound quality of our sessions. For the most effective treatment, please assure you reduce all possibilities of interruptions for the duration of our scheduled appointment. Please know that per best practices and ethical guidelines I can only practice in the state(s) I am licensed in. That means wherever you reside I must be licensed. You agree to inform me if your therapy location has changed or if you have relocated your domicile to a different jurisdiction.</p></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr><td><p><strong>Connection Loss During Phone Sessions:</strong> If we lose our phone connection during our session, I will call you back immediately. If we are unable to reach each other due to technological issues, I will attempt to call you 3 times. If I cannot reach you, I will remain available to you during the entire course of our scheduled session. Should we resume contact, and there is time left in your session we will continue. If the reason for a connection loss i.e. technology, your phone battery dying, bad reception, etc. occurs on your part, you will still be charged for the entire session. If the loss for connection is a result of something on my end, I will call you from an alternate number. The number may show up as restricted or blocked please be sure to pick it up.</p></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Connection Loss During Video Sessions:</strong> If we lose our connection during a video session, I will call you to troubleshoot the reason we lost connection. Please also attempt to call me through your doxey.me link if I cannot reach you. If we are unable to reach each other due to technological issues, I will attempt to call you 3 times. If I cannot reach you, I will remain available to you during the entire course of our scheduled session. Should you contact me back and there is time left in your session we will continue. If the reason for a connection loss occurs on your part, you will still be charged for the entire session. If the loss for connection is a result of something on my end, we can either complete our session via phone or plan an alternate time to complete the remaining minutes of our session.</p></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Recording of Sessions:</strong> Please note that recording, screenshots, etc. of any kind of any session is not permitted and are grounds for termination of the client-therapist relationship.</p></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr> <td><p><strong>Payment for Services:</strong> Payments for services must be made prior to each session. I will charge your card on file or send you an invoice. Payment is to be completed prior to our session.</p></td></tr><tr> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Cancellation Policy:</strong> If you must cancel or reschedule an appointment, 24-hour advance notice is required, otherwise you will be held financially responsible. Should you cancel or miss an appointment with notification less than 24 hours this will result in being charged the no show for your missed appointment. Cancellations must be communicated by phone, NOT email or text. If the client cancels or misses the session with less than 24 hours notice and the session is pre-paid, this follows the cancelation guidelines and the payment will not be reimbursed for the missed or canceled session less than 24 hours. Video/Phone sessions should be treated as regular in office sessions. If you are late getting on the video session, are unable to talk at our scheduled time, your battery has died and you are unable to access another confidential place to talk, or any other variable that  would have you not be able to attend our session please know that you will be charged for the session.
